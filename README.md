## What is this? 🧐

It's a library to extract ISBN numbers from PDFs, created long ago (circa 2008).

## Why is this here? 📌

It's here because it's needed as a dependency for [DataCrow](https://datacrow.sourceforge.net), and the revival effort 
I'm putting in around it.

## Who is the Author? 🕵️

The original author of the code is [Cédric Chabanois](https://github.com/cchabanois) - at least, from what I can gather.
The primary source being [DataCrow Ticket #183](https://sourceforge.net/p/datacrow/feature-requests/183/).

## What's the License? ⚖️

The original source code was Licensed under the GNU General Public License, Version 2 - according to the 
[Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20101228022457/http://isbnextractor.sourceforge.net/dokuwiki/doku.php).
Despite that, the source code was not made readily available by the author.

The code found in the initial git commit is likely a little bodged by Fernflower, but is functionally identical.

Changes made in the code after the initial commit will be licensed under the GNU General Public License, Version 3.

## Cool, how do I...? 🤷

Hold it right there, partner. You're jumping the horse. I have no intention of actually _supporting_ this library. It is
simply a stop-gap measure until either A) a suitable replacement is found, or B) I drop my DataCrow revival efforts.
